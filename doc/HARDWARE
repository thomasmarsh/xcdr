Hardware Requirements
---------------------

There are a number of variables involved when deciding upon your :

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
STORAGE
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Storage requirements vary based upon how much data you want to buffer in the
event of an outage, and how many months of data you wish to store on the
Central Store. Recommended storage amounts are:

	Mediation Instance:	180 GB

	Billing Instance:	180 GB

	Central Store:		1 TB

Hot-swappable RAID is highly desireable; especially on machines where CDR
traffic is held locally on the Mediation instance.


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
MEMORY
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Mediation and Billing instances can survive on 256 MB of RAM but will use
everything you can provide. The recommended amount is 1 GB at a minimum, and
will enable large insert buffers.


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
CPU
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

The development system is an AMD 2000+ (1.56 Ghz) single CPU machine. Ideally
each Mediation and Billing instance should have two CPU's. Depending on the
desired thoroughput, you may wish to increase this to 4- or 8-way
configurations.
