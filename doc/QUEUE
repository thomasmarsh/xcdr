The tables CDR_RAW, and CDR are queues which will be cleared when processed.

The tables both have a status column which can have values:

	'R'	READY
	'M'	MARKED FOR PROCESSING (READING)
	'T'	TRANSACTIONAL (INSERTION)

When the Handler wants to process records in CDR_RAW the following pseudo-
code shows the logic involved in maintining the records across queue
boundaries:

	UPDATE CDR_RAW SET status = 'M' WHERE manufacturer = <gw_mfg>

	SELECT * FROM CDR_RAW WHERE status = 'M' and manufacturer = <gw_mfg>

	for each record:

		parse record

		mediate record

		insert mediated record into CDR with status = 'T'
	
	if catch exception:

		DELETE FROM CDR WHERE status = 'T' and manufacturer = <gw_mfg>

		UPDATE CDR_RAW SET status = 'R' WHERE status = 'M' and manufacturer = <gw_mfg>

	UPDATE CDR SET status = 'R' WHERE status = 'T' AND manufacturer = <gw_mfg>

	DELETE FROM CDR_RAW WHERE status = 'M' AND manufacturer = <gw_mfg>


Not shown here is the use of the QueueManager which assigns a unique identifier
to each queue transfer to prevent simultaneous Handlers from stepping on each
others' feet.
