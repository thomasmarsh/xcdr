INSTALLING XCDR
---------------

Installation of the base XCDR system consists of the following actions:

	- create user 'xcdr' and group 'xcdr'

	- create the xcdr home directory (default /home/xcdr)

	- as root, run the install script included with the XCDR distribution.

The install script will create the following directory structure within the xcdr home directory:

	~/etc
	~/bin
	~/lib
	~/var
	~/var/cache
	~/var/run
	~/var/log
	~/var/log/reader
	~/var/log/mediator

The following files are installed:

	~/etc:

		- config.xml
		- profile

	~/bin:

		- xcdr_mediator
		- xcdr_reader
		- xcdr_callgen_sonus

	~/lib:
		- libxcdrCommon-<ver>-<ver>.so
		- libxcdrCommon-<ver>.so (symlink)
		- libxcdrCommon-<ver>.a
		- libxcdrCommon-<ver>.la
		- libxcdrGWSonus-<ver>-<ver>.so
		- libxcdrGWSonus-<ver>.so (symlink)
		- libxcdrGWSonus-<ver>.a
		- libxcdrGWSonus-<ver>.la

All files will be chowned xcdr:xcdr by the install script.

NOTE: It is important to modify the xcdr user's .bashrc or equivalent to import
      the file ~xcdr/etc/profile as this sets XCDR's PATH and LD_LIBRARY_PATH
      environment variables.
