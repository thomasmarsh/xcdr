FileReader
----------

The file reader needs the following information to run:

	- location of the lockfile
	- connection details for the database
	- location of the input file
	- node id for which we are processing
	- whether this is primary or secondary file

Basic program flow is:

	check lock file:
		if available, or no lock exists:
			create lock
		else
			exit with warning "reader is already running"
	
	open input file read-only

	if error:
		exit with warning "cannot open file"

	open database connection (or exit with warning if fails)

	get reader details (node id, primary/secondary, etc)

	get last retrieved line for current file from database

	rollforward to current line

	until system exit called:

		read N lines (defined in reader config)

		for each line:
			insert into CDR_RAW table marked status = 'T'

		update last retrieved line in database

		mark CDR_RAW table with status = 'R'

	exit
